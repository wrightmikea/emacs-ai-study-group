## Documentation

### [Emacs Lisp Development Guide](./docs/elisp-development.md)

A comprehensive guide for developing Emacs Lisp code, especially when working with AI coding agents. Topics include:
- Best practices for AI-assisted Elisp development
- Tools and techniques to avoid parenthesis mismatches (paredit, smartparens, lispy)
- When and how to use cl-lib features
- Lexical binding and scoping
- Naming conventions and package prefixes
- Keybinding conventions and reserved keys
- Code formatting and file structure
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with setup instructions and examples.

For developing Emacs Lisp code (especially with AI assistance), start with the [Elisp Development Guide](./docs/elisp-development.md).

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own examples, configurations, and learnings to the respective project directories.
