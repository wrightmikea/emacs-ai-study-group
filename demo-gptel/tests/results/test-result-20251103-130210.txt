=== AUTOMATED TEST RESULT ===

Timestamp: Mon Nov  3 13:02:10 2025
Backend: Ollama
Model: llama3.2:latest

=== PROMPT SENT ===
Write ONLY an Emacs Lisp function called fizzbuzz that takes argument n and prints FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to n. Use dotimes and message. Return ONLY the function definition.

=== AI RESPONSE (RAW) ===
```emacs-lisp
(defun fizzbuzz (n)
  (dotimes (i (1- n))
    (cond ((or (= i %3) (= i %5)) 
           (message "FizzBuzz"))
          ((= i %3) 
           (message "Fizz"))
          ((= i %5) 
           (message "Buzz"))))
```

Note: The `(1- n)` is used to generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

=== EXTRACTED CODE ===
(defun fizzbuzz (n)
  (dotimes (i (1- n))
    (cond ((or (= i %3) (= i %5)) 
           (message "FizzBuzz"))
          ((= i %3) 
           (message "Fizz"))
          ((= i %5) 
           (message "Buzz"))))


=== ANALYSIS ===
Status: ✗ MISTAKES FOUND

Mistakes:
  ✗ Uses %N syntax (not valid in Emacs Lisp)

Suggestions:
  → Replace with (mod i N)

=== EVALUATION TEST ===
✗ Code failed to evaluate
Error: End of file during parsing

=== CORRECTED CODE ===
(defun fizzbuzz (n)
  (dotimes (i (1- n))
    (cond ((or (zerop (mod i 3)) (zerop (mod i 5))) 
           (message "FizzBuzz"))
          ((zerop (mod i 3)) 
           (message "Fizz"))
          ((zerop (mod i 5)) 
           (message "Buzz"))))


=== TESTING CORRECTED CODE ===
